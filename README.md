# website project thingy

welcome, this is the open source project for https://choccymilk.uk

# what you'll need to get started
1. discord account (live data, activity, PFP etc.)
2. pronouns.page account - optional but recommended (timezone, flags/custom flags, pronouns etc.)
3. editing skills (open config.js to configure the website to your liking)
4. your own back-end for handling apis and what not (can be repl.it or hop.io)

# how do I publish it?
1. fork the repository to your account (use github desktop to get the code locally (recommended))
2. edit config.js to your liking, you can find what each variable does directly in the file (should appear as a green text)

3. join the Lanyard discord server: https://discord.gg/lanyard (joining the server will make the files accounts.js and discord.js work with your discord ID, which displays your profile and connections) (THIS IS NEEDED)

4. host the website, this comes to your personal preference, you can use cloudflare for hosting your website: https://dash.cloudflare.com, select "workers and pages" -> "pages" and follow the instructions, you can either connect your repository, or upload files directly from your computer

CONFIGS WITH "⚠️" MUST HAVE AN INPUT, OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK

# notes
