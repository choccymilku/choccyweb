# website project thingy

welcome, this is the open source project for https://choccymilk.uk

# what you'll need to get started
1. discord account (live data, activity, PFP etc.)
2. pronouns.page account - optional but recommended (timezone, flags/custom flags, pronouns etc.)
3. editing skills (open config.js to configure the website to your liking)

# how do I publish it?
1. download the repository by clicking the green button and select "download as a ZIP" from the dropdown (alternatively copy this repository onto your account or use github desktop) 
2. edit config.js to your liking, you can find what each variable does directly in the file (should appear as a green text)

3. join the Lanyard discord server: https://discord.gg/lanyard (joining the server will make the files accounts.js and discord.js work with your discord ID, which displays your profile and connections)

4. host the website, this comes to your personal preference, to start off, you can use cloudflare for hosting your website: https://dash.cloudflare.com and select "workers and pages", then click on "pages" and follow the instructions, you can either connect your repository, or upload files directly from your computer.

CONFIGS WITH "⚠️" MUST HAVE AN INPUT, OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK

# notes
